## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have **Java 17** or above installed in your Computer and it is compatible with your device operating system (Mac or Windows).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from nmarwah7/ip repository under latest release.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Ultron.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the  `java -jar ultron.jar` command to run the application.
Ultron should appear in your terminal window as shown below. Note the app will generate a data.txt file in this home folder which
will be empty when the app is first launched.

5. Type the command in the terminal window and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing list and pressing Enter will list all stored tasks.
Some example commands you can try:

   `list` : Lists all tasks.

    `todo finish my work`  : Adds a task you have to do with a brief description.

    `delete 3 `: Deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list.

    `deadline assignment /by 2023-01-11` : Adds a task you have to do that involves a deadline with a brief description and due by date in _YYYY-MM-DD format_.

    `bye` : Exits the app.

Refer to the Features below for details of each command.

and must correspond to an existing task in the list.

_**Format**_: `unmark <list_index>`

### Deleting a task `delete`

## Saving the data
Ultron task data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

## Editing the data file

Ultron task data is saved automatically as a .txt file [JAR file location]/data/data.txt. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

> CAUTION!:
> The data file has particular formatting, any change to this file that violates this formatting could **corrupt the data** and would require the data file to be deleted
and started again. Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.



## Known issues
1. If you would like to enter a deadline due by date, you cannot enter any format other than YYYY-MM-DD due to how the program stores and displays
this date back to this user. However, event time frame is more flexible and there is no need to follow this time format in the `/from <time> /to <time>`
command parameters.
2. The paramters `/from` or `/to`, for example, include a forward **not** a backward slash.
